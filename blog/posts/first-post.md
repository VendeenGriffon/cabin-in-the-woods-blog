# First Fireside Thoughts

The snow fell heavier than expected today. I spent most of it inside, thinking about what stories are worth telling.

Something about the cold makes every word feel deliberate. I want this blog to feel like letters left on a wooden desk, warm to the touch but cool in their silence.

Until next time,
J.
